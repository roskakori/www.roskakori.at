DESCRIPTION

  WgetRexx is an ARexx script to invoke Wget from your favourite Amiga
  WWW browser. It is designed in a way that you can easily maintain a
  copy of the interesting parts of the WWW on your local hard drive.

  This allows you to browse them without having to start your network,
  without having to worry if documents are still in the cache of the
  browser, without having to figure out the cryptic name of a certain
  document in your cache directory and without having to deal with
  slow, overloaded or/and unstable connections.

FEATURES

  If configured properly, WgetRexx allows you to download pages with
  images or whole web sites with one mouse click.

NEW FEATURES

  - Fixed bug causing endless loop
  - Fixed bug when downloading dynamic web pages
  - Added script to generate index document for Web:

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  You need an open network connection, either Miami or AmiTCP, and one
  of the following WWW browsers running when invoking the script:

  - AWeb
  - IBrowse

  Other browsers are not supported yet because they currently lack
  sufficient ARexx-capabilities (like Voyager).

  Some additional libraries are required. All of them can be obtained
  from Aminet:

  - util/libs/ReqToolsUsr.lha
  - util/rexx/rexxdossupport.lha
  - util/libs/ixemul-#?.lha

  Of course you need Wget. It is part of the Geek Gadgets project, but
  can also be obtained from Aminet:

  - dev/gg/wget-bin.lha
  - dev/gg/wget-src.lha

  Refer to the manual for more details.

AVAILABILITY

  - Via FTP from every Aminet-mirror, file "comm/www/WgetRexx.lha", for
    example:
