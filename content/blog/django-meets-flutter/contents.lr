intro:

The Django framework is one option to implement RESTful API's using the Python
programming language. In combination with its integrated ORM it is particular well suited to provide CRUD 
operations to relational data via REST. However, web sites rendered with Django
templates offer only limited interactivity and responsiveness compared ro modern 
responsive and interactive web site.

Flutter allows to implement mobile application in a platform independent manner using
a single code base written in the Dart language.

In this Meetup the Python and Flutter community of Graz team up and implement a small
example application showing how Django and Flutter can work together and view and edit
data stored in an SQL database.
